        The Broward College IT Department began as a small campus computing
        support group and has grown into a comprehensive center for teaching,
        learning, and infrastructure. Over time it has expanded labs,
        classrooms, and online resources to keep pace with rapid technology
        change and student needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The department supports a range of workforce-focused programs and
        certificates—networking, server and systems administration, database
        administration, cloud technologies, and cybersecurity—blending classroom
        instruction with hands‑on lab work, industry tools, and internship
        opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Collaboration with local employers and technology partners ensures
        curricula remain aligned with real-world skills and certification
        standards. The department is committed to student success, career
        placement, and ongoing curriculum updates that reflect emerging industry
        practices.
