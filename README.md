        Optional: A CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI) for faster development

    Website Structure:
        Homepage:
            Department overview and mission
            Featured programs or courses
            Contact information
            Call-to-action (e.g., Apply now, Request information)
        About Us:
            Department history, faculty, and staff
            Department goals and objectives
        Programs:
